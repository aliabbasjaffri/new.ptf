summary: |
  There is a fundamental problem in technology funding and especially in FOSS funding: The beginning of the innovation process is readily financed, but it often remains unclear how to proceed afterwards. Few technologies are ready to go live and sustain themselves after the initial funding. That's why we offer the opportunity to work on securing a sustainable future for the project in four more months of funding with the Second Stage. This is done, for example, by building a community, distributing and improving the usability of the software, or by setting up an association structure. To do this, the grantees take part in business coachings, do public relations work, conduct user tests, or take care of the documentation of their work â€“ depending entirely on what the individual project needs.

  When you initially apply, you can indicate that you want to be funded with your project in the Second Stage. Three months after the start of the regular funding phase, a low-threshold application and selection process follows, in which 10-15 projects are selected.
