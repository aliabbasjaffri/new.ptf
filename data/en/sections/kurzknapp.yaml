summary: |
  The Prototype Fund is the first low-threshold funding program for independent developers and small teams creating innovative open-source software. We provide the tech-savvy civil society with access to the resources and processes needed for developing user-centered, innovative software projects.\
  Since 2016, we have funded almost 400 projects. As a learning funding program, we have repeatedly made adjustments to become more efficient and effective. Now we are taking the next step and implementing some changes. For the future funding phases, we are focusing on funding [data security](/files/DataSecurity.pdf) and [software infrastructure](/files/SoftwareInfrastructure.pdf).

  Apply with your ideas for innovative open source software in the public interest! You will receive up to €95,000 over 6 months or €158,000 over 10 months of funding by the German Ministry of Education and Research. We will also provide you with coaching, consulting and networking opportunities.
